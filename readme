Welcome

To run the program you need to chose what environment to run, the environment is based on the input file.
Currently input.txt has a default environment, but you can change it to any of your choosing (as long as it is in the correct format, the same one currently used).

To set the evidence change line 70 in main to your desired evidence 

(keep in this format, for example: "evidence = {"Ev(1)": "1", "W": "mild", "B(2)" : "0"}").

and then run the program with the command:

    python3 main.py




Enjoy! :)
